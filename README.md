# Jiphy
This is a Jif Infinite Scroller. This application demonstrates gifs in a gallary format and in a theatre full-screen view. This project was for a freelance client who wanted to display gifs that they were sourcing. For the purposes of having this on my portfolio, I have changed the branding and have employed the Giphy API to source my gifs.
